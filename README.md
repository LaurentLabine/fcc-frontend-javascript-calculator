# freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Projects - Build a JavaScript Calculator

## Checkout the project here : https://laurentlabine.github.io/fcc-javascript-calculator/
## What is this

I built this project as part of freeCodeCamp's curriculum to learn and practice Responsive Web Design.

## What Technologies have been used?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

It is built using the React Library coupled to Styled-Component's global stylesalong with eslint and prettier extensions for code formatting.

LightHouse audits have also been added to workflow using github actions in order to keep track of the application's performance using Lighthouse Reports

It answers the technical requirements as stated in the challenge located here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator with the tests that can be run from the page itself.

## Possible Improvements?

However technically functional, the project could benefit a refactor of the logic and splitting of the multiple components for simplicity and clarity purposes.

Future possible improvements could include implementing using React Hooks as well as adding a media request and a different layout for smaller screens.
