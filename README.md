# freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Projects - Project 4 - Build a Javascript Calculator

See the result here: https://laurentlabine.github.io/fcc-javascript-calculator/

I built this project as part of freeCodeCamp's curriculum to learn and practice Responsive Web Design.

## Technologies

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

It is built using the React Library coupled to Styled-Components and Material UI components for the styling along with eslint and prettier extensions for linting and code formatting.

LightHouse audits have also been added to workflow using github actions in order to keep track of the application's performance using Lighthouse Reports

It answers the technical requirements as stated in the challenge located here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator with the tests that can be run from the page itself.

## Possible Improvements

While being functional, the project could benefit a refactor of the logic and splitting of the multiple components to make it more reacty.

Future possible improvements could include implementing using React Hooks as well as adding a media request and a different layout for smaller screens.
