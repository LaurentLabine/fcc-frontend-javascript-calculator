# freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Projects - Build a JavaScript CalculatorPassed
## What is this

I built this project as part of freeCodeCamp's curriculum to learn and practice Responsive Web Design.

## What Technologies have been used?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

It is built using the React Library coupled to Styled-Components and Material UI components for the styling along with eslint and prettier extensions for linting and code formatting.

LightHouse audits have also been added to workflow using github actions in order to keep track of the application's performance using Lighthouse Reports

It answers the technical requirements as stated in the challenge located here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator with the tests that can be run from the page itself.

## What's it look like?

It (as well as the resources in it) is hosted on github Pages for simplicity and it is accessible here: https://laurentlabine.github.io/fcc-javascript-calculator/

## Possible Improvements?

Future possible improvements could include implementing using React Hooks as well as adding a media request and a different layout for smaller screens.
